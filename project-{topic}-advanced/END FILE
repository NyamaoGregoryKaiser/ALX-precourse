This is a highly simplified example.  To reach 2000+ lines of code and a truly production-ready system, you would need to:

* **Implement full CRUD operations:**  Add the remaining HTTP methods (PUT, DELETE, PATCH) for tasks.
* **Add Authentication:** Integrate a system like JWT or OAuth 2.0.
* **Implement comprehensive error handling:**  Handle exceptions gracefully and return informative error messages.
* **Add a caching layer:** Use Redis or Memcached to improve performance.
* **Implement rate limiting:**  Prevent abuse of the API.
* **Write extensive tests:**  Aim for high test coverage (80%+). Include unit, integration, and API tests.
* **Set up a CI/CD pipeline:** Automate building, testing, and deploying the application.  GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, or Jenkins are popular choices.
* **Add logging and monitoring:** Integrate with tools like ELK stack or similar.
* **Improve database design:** Add more robust schema and relationships if needed.
* **Implement a frontend:**  Create a user interface using React, Vue, Angular, or similar.

Remember to replace placeholder values like passwords and database credentials with your actual values.  This expanded framework will guide you towards building your full-scale project.  This will likely involve significantly more code than what I can provide here.
