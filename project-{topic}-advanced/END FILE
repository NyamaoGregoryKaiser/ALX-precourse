...(This would continue with user models, authentication middleware, migration scripts, tests, Dockerfile, etc.  The complete system would be substantially larger.)...


This is a highly simplified example. A real-world e-commerce application would necessitate considerably more code, sophisticated error handling, robust security measures, and a far more complex database schema.  This skeletal framework demonstrates the basic architectural components.  Remember to replace placeholder database credentials and expand upon this foundation to build a complete e-commerce solution.  You will also need to implement significant testing, CI/CD pipelines, and more detailed documentation.  This example only scratches the surface of what's required.
