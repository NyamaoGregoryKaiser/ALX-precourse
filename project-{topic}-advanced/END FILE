This is a very basic example.  You will need to expand significantly upon this to meet the requirements outlined in the prompt. This includes adding authentication, authorization,  more robust error handling, logging, comprehensive testing, a CI/CD pipeline (using tools like GitLab CI, GitHub Actions, or Jenkins), and more sophisticated database interactions.  Remember to consult the documentation for Flask, SQLAlchemy, and your chosen testing and CI/CD tools.  The frontend would require a more substantial framework for a production-ready application.  This simplified example is intended as a starting point.
