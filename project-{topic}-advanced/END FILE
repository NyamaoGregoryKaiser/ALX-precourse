This is a highly simplified example.  A real-world application would require significantly more code to handle:

* **Networking:**  Robust handling of connections, disconnections, error conditions, and message queuing.  Consider libraries like Boost.Asio or similar for C++.
* **Database:**  A well-designed schema, efficient queries, and proper error handling.  Choose a suitable database system (PostgreSQL, MySQL, etc.)
* **Authentication/Authorization:**  Implement secure user authentication (e.g., JWT) and authorization mechanisms to control access.
* **Error Handling:** Implement comprehensive error handling throughout the application.
* **Concurrency:** Manage concurrent connections efficiently using threads or asynchronous operations.
* **Frontend:** Build a user interface using a JavaScript framework to interact with the backend API.
* **Testing:** Write unit, integration, and end-to-end tests to ensure the application's reliability.
* **Deployment:** Configure a deployment pipeline (using Docker, Kubernetes, etc.)
