This is a highly simplified example. A production-ready system would require:

* **Detailed implementation of controllers and middleware:**  Including robust input validation, authentication (JWT or OAuth), authorization (RBAC or ABAC), rate limiting, and comprehensive error handling.
* **Comprehensive testing:** Unit, integration, and end-to-end tests are crucial.  Aim for high test coverage.
* **Deployment scripts:**  Automated deployment using Docker and a CI/CD pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions, GitLab CI).
* **Detailed documentation:** API specifications, database schema, architecture diagrams, and deployment instructions.
* **Security best practices:**  Regular security audits, vulnerability scanning, and secure coding practices are essential.
* **Database migrations and seeds:**  Manage database schema changes and populate initial data securely.
* **Caching layer (Redis):**  Improve performance and reduce database load.
* **Logging and monitoring:** Implement robust logging and monitoring to track application health and identify potential issues.


This skeletal example provides a starting point. Remember to consult security best practices and expand this foundation to create a fully functional and secure application.  Remember to replace the `// ...` comments with actual implementation details.  This task requires substantial development effort to reach a production-ready state.
