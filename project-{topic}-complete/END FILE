**(This is a highly simplified example.  You need to add more models, controllers, routes, and comprehensive error handling, authentication, authorization, and testing.)**

Remember to create a `config/config.json` file for database credentials and a `routes` folder to organize your API endpoints.  You'll also need to implement authentication (e.g., using JWT), comprehensive error handling, and robust testing.  This structure provides a basic foundation; expanding it into a production-ready application requires substantial additional development.  Consider using a more robust framework like NestJS or similar for larger projects.  Finally, remember to add proper error handling, input validation, and security measures throughout your codebase.  This example is only a starting point to illustrate the basic structure.
