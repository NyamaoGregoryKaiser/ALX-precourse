This is a highly simplified example.  A production-ready system would require:

* **Robust Authentication and Authorization:**  Implement secure authentication (e.g., using JWTs) and authorization mechanisms (e.g., role-based access control).
* **Comprehensive Error Handling:**  Implement thorough error handling throughout the application, including proper logging and user-friendly error messages.
* **Extensive Testing:**  Write unit, integration, and API tests to ensure the system's correctness and reliability. Aim for high test coverage.
* **Caching:** Implement caching strategies (e.g., Redis) to improve performance.
* **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting to protect against abuse.
* **Logging and Monitoring:** Integrate logging and monitoring tools (e.g., Winston, Prometheus, Grafana) to track system performance and identify potential issues.
* **Dockerization and CI/CD:**  Use Docker to containerize the application and set up a CI/CD pipeline for automated builds, testing, and deployment.
* **Actual Query Optimization Logic:** Replace the placeholder in `queryOptimizer.js` with real database optimization logic, potentially using database introspection and analysis tools.


Remember to replace placeholder comments with actual code and implement the missing components.  This expanded framework should give you a solid starting point for building your database optimization system.  Remember that building a fully functional system of this complexity requires significantly more code and careful planning.
