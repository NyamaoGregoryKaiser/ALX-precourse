Remember to create a `.env` file with your database connection string:

```
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@host:port/database
```

This is a highly simplified example.  A production-ready system would require:

* **Robust error handling:**  More comprehensive error handling and logging.
* **Authentication and Authorization:**  Implementing secure authentication (e.g., JWT) and authorization mechanisms (e.g., RBAC).
* **Extensive Testing:** More thorough unit, integration, and performance testing to ensure stability and scalability.
* **Deployment:** Setting up a proper CI/CD pipeline (e.g., using GitLab CI, GitHub Actions, or Jenkins) for automated builds, testing, and deployment.
* **Database Migrations:**  Using Alembic or similar tools for managing database schema changes.
* **Caching:** Implementing a caching layer (e.g., Redis) to improve performance.
* **Monitoring and Alerting:**  Using tools like Prometheus and Grafana to monitor the application's performance and health.


This expanded response gives you a more realistic starting point.  Remember to adapt and expand this framework based on your specific requirements and the ALX Software Engineering precourse materials.  The code size would increase substantially as you implement the missing features.
