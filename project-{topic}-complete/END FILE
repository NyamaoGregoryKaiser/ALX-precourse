This is a highly simplified example.  A production-ready system would require significantly more code, including robust error handling, comprehensive testing, detailed documentation, and more sophisticated security measures.  Remember to install all necessary dependencies using `npm install`. You will also need to configure a PostgreSQL database and Redis (for caching).  This structure provides a foundation to build upon, emphasizing the ALX curriculum's focus on logic, algorithms, and problem-solving.  You will need to implement the database interactions, detailed business logic, testing suite, and other missing pieces.  A CI/CD pipeline would require integration with a platform like GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, or Jenkins.
