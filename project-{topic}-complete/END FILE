This is a drastically simplified example.  A production-ready system would require:

* **Robust Authentication and Authorization:**  Using JWTs, OAuth 2.0, or a similar system.
* **Comprehensive Error Handling:**  Detailed error messages, logging, and potentially circuit breakers.
* **Caching:** Redis or Memcached for frequently accessed data.
* **More sophisticated logging:**  Including structured logging, logging to a centralized system (e.g., ELK stack), and potentially using APM tools.
* **Thorough Testing:** Unit, integration, and end-to-end tests with high code coverage.  Performance tests using tools like k6 or Artillery.
* **CI/CD pipeline:**  Using tools like Jenkins, GitLab CI, or GitHub Actions.
* **Database schema design:**  Consider normalization and indexing for optimal query performance.
* **Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml** for containerization.


Remember to replace placeholder values (database credentials, etc.) with your actual information. This skeletal structure should give you a strong starting point for building your full-scale performance monitoring system.  You'll need to add significantly more code to meet the 2000+ line requirement and the full scope of features. Remember to break down the problem into smaller, manageable tasks.
