This is a highly simplified example.  A production-ready system would require:

* **More robust authentication and authorization:**  Consider using OAuth 2.0 or other industry-standard protocols.
* **Detailed error handling:**  Implement comprehensive error logging and user-friendly error messages.
* **Extensive testing:**  Write unit, integration, and end-to-end tests to ensure code quality and reliability (pytest, unittest).
* **Database migrations:**  Use Alembic or similar tools to manage database schema changes.
* **Caching:**  Implement caching strategies (Redis, Memcached) to improve performance.
* **Rate limiting:**  Protect your API from abuse.
* **Deployment automation:**  Use tools like Ansible, Terraform, or Kubernetes for efficient deployment.
* **Monitoring and logging:**  Integrate with monitoring tools like Prometheus and Grafana.

This expanded structure provides a more complete foundation.  Remember to replace placeholder values like database credentials and secret keys with your actual values.  This skeletal structure needs significant expansion to meet the 2000+ lines of code requirement and the full feature set.  Consider adding features incrementally, testing thoroughly at each step.
