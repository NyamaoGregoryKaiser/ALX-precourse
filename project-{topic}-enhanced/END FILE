This is a very rudimentary example.  A real-world CMS would require:

* **Frontend:**  A substantial frontend (likely using React, Angular, Vue.js, or similar) to handle user interactions and display content.
* **Database:**  A robust database system like PostgreSQL or MySQL with a well-defined schema, including tables for users, articles, comments, categories, etc.
* **API Framework:** A framework like RESTEasy (for C++) to handle API requests and responses efficiently.
* **Authentication/Authorization:** Secure authentication (e.g., using JWT) and authorization mechanisms to control access to resources.
* **Testing Framework:**  A comprehensive testing framework (e.g., Google Test) for unit, integration, and API tests.
* **Deployment:**  A strategy for deployment, potentially using cloud platforms like AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure.

This simplified illustration provides a starting point.  To create a complete CMS, you would need to address each of these aspects with considerably more code and detailed implementation.  Remember to break down the project into smaller, manageable modules to facilitate development and testing.  Consider using a version control system (like Git) throughout the entire process.
