This is a drastically simplified example. A real-world application would need:

* **Robust Database Integration:**  Replace the `messages` map with a proper database (PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, etc.) using an ORM or database driver.  You'll need schema design, migration scripts, and efficient query handling.
* **Authentication and Authorization:** Implement secure user authentication (e.g., JWT) and authorization to control access to chat rooms and messages.
* **Error Handling:** Implement comprehensive error handling and logging to gracefully handle exceptions and network issues.
* **Frontend Development:** Create a fully functional frontend using a JavaScript framework to handle user interface, real-time communication (using WebSockets), and user interaction.
* **Scalability and Performance:** Design for scalability by considering load balancing, message queues (e.g., RabbitMQ, Kafka), and caching strategies.
* **Comprehensive Testing:** Implement a complete suite of unit, integration, and end-to-end tests to ensure code quality and stability.


Remember to install the necessary libraries (like websocketpp) before compiling and running the server.  This skeletal example serves as a starting point; building a full-scale application requires significantly more code and planning.  Break down the project into smaller, manageable tasks, focusing on one component at a time.  Use version control (Git) to track your progress.
