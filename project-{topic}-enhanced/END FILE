This is a minimal example.  You would need to add:

* **More robust error handling:**  Handle exceptions gracefully and return meaningful error messages.
* **Security configurations:**  Configure Spring Security for proper authorization and authentication (including JWT validation).
* **Comprehensive testing:**  Write unit, integration, and API tests for all components.
* **Database schema:**  Create a proper schema for users and other entities.
* **Frontend:**  Develop a user interface (React, Angular, etc.) for user interaction.
* **Deployment:**  Configure a CI/CD pipeline (e.g., using Jenkins, GitLab CI) and a deployment strategy (e.g., using Docker).
* **Logging and monitoring:** Integrate a logging framework (e.g., Logback, SLF4j) and monitoring tools.
* **Rate limiting:** Implement mechanisms to prevent abuse.
* **Caching:** Introduce a caching layer (e.g., Redis) to improve performance.


Remember to replace placeholder values (database credentials, secret key) with your actual values.  This example provides a starting point; building a full-scale, production-ready system requires substantially more effort and code.  This is just a fraction of the 2000+ lines needed for a complete system.
