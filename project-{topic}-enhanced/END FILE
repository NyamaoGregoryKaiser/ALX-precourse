This is a highly simplified illustration. A full-scale project would require:

* **Extensive Backend Logic:**  Handling model training, prediction, feature engineering, etc., potentially using libraries like TensorFlow.js or similar.
* **Frontend Development:**  A React, Vue, or Angular application to interact with the backend API.
* **Authentication & Authorization:** Implement robust authentication (e.g., OAuth 2.0) and authorization mechanisms using JWTs or similar.
* **Comprehensive Testing:**  Unit, integration, and end-to-end tests covering all aspects of the system.
* **Dockerfile:**  To containerize the application for easy deployment.
* **CI/CD Pipeline:**  Using tools like GitLab CI, GitHub Actions, or Jenkins to automate building, testing, and deployment.
* **Error Handling and Logging:**  Implement robust error handling and logging mechanisms.
* **Database Design:**  A carefully designed database schema to handle the data effectively.

Remember to replace placeholder passwords with securely hashed passwords using a library like bcrypt. This example is for illustrative purposes only and lacks many crucial security and production readiness elements.  Building a production-ready system necessitates significantly more code and careful planning.
