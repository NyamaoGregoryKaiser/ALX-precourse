This is a vastly simplified example.  A real-world payment system would require:

* **Secure Payment Gateway Integration:**  Stripe, PayPal, Braintree, etc., handle sensitive card data.
* **Robust Security:**  HTTPS, input validation, authentication, authorization, encryption at rest and in transit.
* **Error Handling and Logging:** Detailed logging for debugging and auditing.
* **Transaction Management:**  Guaranteeing atomicity and consistency.
* **Scalability and Performance:**  Handling high transaction volumes.
* **Compliance:**  Meeting PCI DSS and other relevant regulations.
* **Testing:**  Extensive unit, integration, and end-to-end tests.


Remember to replace placeholder values like database credentials and JWT secret with your own.  This example provides a starting point; a production-ready system requires significantly more development and expertise.  This response only scratches the surface of what a complete payment processing system would entail.  It is crucial to prioritize security in any payment processing system.  Never handle sensitive card details directly. Always use a reputable payment gateway.
