A production-ready application requires far more robust error handling, input validation, security measures (OWASP top 10 considerations), and comprehensive testing.  You will need to expand upon this foundation, focusing on the principles taught in the ALX Software Engineering precourse.  Consider researching topics like JWT authentication, rate limiting libraries, and database transaction management.
