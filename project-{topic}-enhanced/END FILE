This is a highly simplified example.  A full-scale project would require:

* **Detailed error handling:**  Robust mechanisms to handle exceptions and database errors.
* **Authentication and Authorization:** Secure access control using JWTs or other methods.
* **Comprehensive Testing:** Unit, integration, and API tests to ensure correctness and stability.
* **Deployment scripts:** Dockerfiles, Kubernetes configurations, or other deployment strategies.
* **A robust machine learning library:**  A production-ready ML system cannot rely on simple placeholder functions.  Use a library like TensorFlow Lite, ONNX Runtime, or similar.  Consider the trade-offs between performance and ease of deployment.


This skeletal structure provides a starting point.  You'll need to fill in the significant gaps with proper implementation, testing, and deployment procedures.  The complexity and code size will easily exceed 2000 lines of code once these components are fully developed. Remember to choose appropriate libraries and carefully manage dependencies.  This expanded example illustrates the significant effort required for a production-ready system.
