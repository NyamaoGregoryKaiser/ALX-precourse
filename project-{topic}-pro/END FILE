This is a highly simplified example.  A production-ready system would need:

* **Robust Authentication and Authorization:**  Implement OAuth 2.0 or OpenID Connect for secure authentication.  Use role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict access to sensitive functionalities.
* **Secure Payment Gateway Integration:** Integrate with a reputable payment gateway like Stripe or PayPal using their APIs.  Never handle sensitive payment information directly on your server.
* **Comprehensive Error Handling:** Implement proper error handling and logging to catch and address issues gracefully.
* **Extensive Testing:**  Write unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests to ensure the system's reliability and correctness.
* **Deployment to a Secure Environment:** Deploy to a cloud provider (AWS, Google Cloud, Azure) with appropriate security measures.
* **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits to identify and address vulnerabilities.


This expanded example provides a more realistic foundation, but still lacks many essential components for a truly production-ready system. Remember to prioritize security and follow best practices throughout your development process.  Consider using a framework like Django for a more structured approach to building a larger application.  The ALX Software Engineering precourse materials should provide a strong base for tackling the algorithmic and logical challenges within the expanded application.
