**(Frontend - React - Illustrative)**

You would need a separate React project (create-react-app or similar) to handle the frontend.  This would include components for displaying queries, submitting optimization requests, and showing results.


**(Testing - Illustrative)**

```javascript
//server.test.js
const request = require('supertest');
const app = require('./server'); //Import your server

describe('API Endpoints', () => {
  it('should get queries', async () => {
    const res = await request(app).get('/api/queries');
    expect(res.statusCode).toBe(200);
    //Add assertions based on your API response
  });
});

```


Remember to implement proper authentication (using JWT or similar), comprehensive error handling, logging, and robust testing throughout the application. This example provides a solid foundation; expand upon it to build the complete, enterprise-grade system.  You'll also need to add a caching layer (e.g., Redis) and integrate a CI/CD pipeline (e.g., using GitHub Actions or GitLab CI).  The query optimization itself would require sophisticated algorithms and analysis depending on the nature of the queries and database.  This could involve analyzing query plans, suggesting indexes, and rewriting queries.  This is a significant undertaking beyond the scope of this concise example.
