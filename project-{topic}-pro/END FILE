This is a very high-level outline.  You'll need to flesh out the database schema, migrations, API endpoints, error handling, authentication (e.g., using JWT), logging, and extensive testing.  Remember to adjust the database URL, secret keys, and other configurations according to your environment.  The CI/CD pipeline would involve tools like GitLab CI, GitHub Actions, or Jenkins and would orchestrate building the Docker image, running tests, and deploying the application to a server.  Remember to add comprehensive documentation.  This example provides a strong foundation to build a complete application. Remember to install Alembic (`pip install alembic`) and run `alembic init migrations` to set up the migrations directory.
