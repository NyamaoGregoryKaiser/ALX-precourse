This is a highly simplified example.  A full-scale system would require:

* **Detailed schema design:**  Including tables for metrics, services, alerts, users, etc.  Consider using database normalization techniques.
* **Robust backend logic:**  Implement data collection, aggregation, analysis, and alert mechanisms.
* **Comprehensive frontend:**  A dashboard to visualize performance data, configure alerts, and manage users.  Consider using React, Vue, or Angular.
* **Authentication and authorization:** Secure your API using JWT or OAuth.
* **Comprehensive testing:**  Unit, integration, and end-to-end tests are crucial.  Consider using Jest, Supertest, and Cypress.
* **CI/CD pipeline:**  Use a platform like GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, or Jenkins to automate building, testing, and deployment.
* **Detailed documentation:**  README, API docs (Swagger/OpenAPI), architecture diagrams, deployment instructions.


Remember to consult the documentation for each library you use and follow best practices for security, scalability, and maintainability.  This expanded outline should give you a stronger starting point for your project.  Remember to break down the project into smaller, manageable tasks.
