This is a highly simplified example. A production-ready system would require:

* **Robust error handling:**  Comprehensive try-catch blocks and error logging throughout the backend.
* **Authentication and authorization:**  Protecting API endpoints using JWT or similar.
* **Data validation:**  Sanitizing and validating all incoming data.
* **Logging and monitoring:**  Using a dedicated logging system (like Winston or Bunyan) and monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana).
* **Testing:**  Extensive unit, integration, and end-to-end tests.
* **Deployment automation:** Using Docker and a CI/CD pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions, GitLab CI).
* **Scalability considerations:** Designing the database and application to handle a high volume of requests.
* **Real-time data streaming:**  Using technologies like WebSockets for real-time updates.
* **More sophisticated metrics:** Collecting CPU, memory, disk I/O, network usage, etc.
* **Alerting:** Configurable alerts based on thresholds.
* **Reporting and visualization:** Generating reports and dashboards.


This skeletal structure provides a starting point.  Remember that building a complete system will take considerable time and effort. You will need to flesh out each component, add more features, and thoroughly test your application.  The ALX precourse materials will be invaluable in developing the programming logic and problem-solving skills needed for this project.
