**(Remember to replace placeholder database credentials and add more comprehensive models, routes, tests and error handling.)**


This is a highly simplified example.  A production-ready system would require:

* **Robust authentication and authorization:**  Implementing user roles and permissions, likely using JWT (JSON Web Tokens).
* **Comprehensive error handling:**  Handling database errors, API errors, and other potential issues gracefully.
* **Extensive testing:**  Unit tests for individual functions, integration tests for interacting components, and end-to-end tests to verify the entire system.
* **Deployment pipeline:** Setting up a CI/CD pipeline using tools like GitLab CI, GitHub Actions, or Jenkins.
* **Logging and monitoring:**  Using tools like ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) for centralized logging and monitoring.
* **Caching:** Implementing caching strategies (e.g., Redis) to improve performance.
* **Rate limiting:** Preventing abuse of your API.
* **A more sophisticated machine learning model:**  Training a model on a larger dataset and deploying it using a framework like TensorFlow.js or scikit-learn.


Remember that this is a starting point. Building a complete system requires significantly more effort and coding.  The code snippets above illustrate the basic framework; you'll need to flesh it out considerably to meet your requirements.  Focus on building incrementally and testing thoroughly at each step.  This response is designed to be a guide, and not a complete solution.
