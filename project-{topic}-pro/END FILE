This is a highly simplified example.  A real-world application would need:

* **Robust error handling:**  Handle exceptions gracefully and return meaningful error messages.
* **Authentication and authorization:** Secure your API using JWTs or other methods.
* **Logging and monitoring:** Integrate with a logging system (e.g., Sentry, ELK stack) for debugging and monitoring.
* **Caching:** Implement caching (e.g., Redis) to improve performance.
* **Rate limiting:** Prevent abuse of your API.
* **Comprehensive testing:** Write unit, integration, and API tests to ensure quality.
* **A much more sophisticated frontend:** Use a framework like React, Vue, or Angular with a charting library (e.g., Chart.js, D3.js, Recharts).
* **Dockerfile:**  For containerization.
* **CI/CD pipeline:** Using GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, or similar.
* **Database schema design:** Carefully design your database schema to handle your expected data volume and relationships.


This expanded outline gives you a stronger foundation to build upon. Remember to break down the project into smaller, manageable tasks and test frequently.  This will help you manage the complexity and ensure a more robust final product.  The code provided here is a starting point, and substantial effort is still required to reach the 2000+ lines of code goal and full functionality.
