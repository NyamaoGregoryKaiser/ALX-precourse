This is a highly simplified example.  A production-ready system would require:

* **Robust authentication and authorization:** Using JWTs or other secure methods.
* **Comprehensive error handling:**  Graceful degradation and logging of errors.
* **Advanced database interactions:**  Complex queries, transactions, and potentially NoSQL databases for scalability.
* **Caching:**  Using Redis or similar for frequently accessed data.
* **Rate limiting:**  Preventing abuse of the API.
* **Detailed logging and monitoring:**  Using tools like Prometheus, Grafana, or ELK stack.
* **Extensive testing:**  Unit, integration, and end-to-end tests.
* **CI/CD pipeline:**  Using tools like GitLab CI, GitHub Actions, or Jenkins.
* **Frontend:** A React, Vue, or Angular application to visualize the data.
