This is a highly simplified example.  A real-world e-commerce application would require:

* **More sophisticated database design:**  Consider relationships between products, users, orders, carts, categories, etc.  Use a relational database like PostgreSQL or MySQL for production.
* **Robust authentication and authorization:** Implement secure user login, roles, and permissions using Spring Security or a similar framework.
* **Comprehensive error handling:** Handle exceptions gracefully and return meaningful error responses.
* **Payment gateway integration:** Integrate with a payment provider like Stripe or PayPal.
* **Shopping cart functionality:** Implement a shopping cart system to allow users to add, remove, and manage items.
* **Order management:** Track orders, manage shipping, and handle returns.
* **Search and filtering:** Implement robust search and filtering capabilities.
* **Frontend development:**  Build a fully functional and user-friendly frontend using a framework like React, Vue, or Angular.


Remember that building a complete e-commerce system is a large project.  Start with a minimal viable product (MVP) and gradually add features as you progress.  Focus on one aspect at a time, testing thoroughly at each stage.  Use version control (Git) to manage your code.  This skeletal example gives you a starting point; you'll need to significantly expand upon it to create a production-ready application.
