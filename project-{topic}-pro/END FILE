This is a highly simplified example.  A full-scale project would require:

* **Robust error handling:**  More comprehensive error handling throughout the application.
* **Complete CRUD operations:** Implement full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for your data model.
* **Detailed schema design:**  A well-defined database schema with appropriate data types and constraints.
* **Comprehensive testing:**  Extensive unit, integration, and API tests to ensure code quality.
* **Dockerfile:**  A `Dockerfile` for containerizing the application and database.
* **CI/CD pipeline:** Setup a CI/CD pipeline (e.g., using GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, or Jenkins) for automated builds, testing, and deployment.
* **Caching Strategy:** Implement caching (e.g., using Redis) to improve performance.
* **Logging and Monitoring:** Integrate logging and monitoring tools (e.g., Winston, Prometheus, Grafana).
* **Security best practices:** Securely handle passwords and sensitive data.


This skeletal structure provides a starting point.  Remember to replace placeholder comments and expand upon the provided code to create a fully functional and optimized system.  Remember to consult the documentation for the libraries used (Express, PostgreSQL, Jest, etc.) for detailed instructions and best practices.  This task is significantly larger than what can be comprehensively delivered within this response's limitations.
