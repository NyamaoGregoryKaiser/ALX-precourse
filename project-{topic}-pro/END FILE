**(This is a highly simplified example.  A full application would include many more entities, routes, controllers, services, and tests.)**


This is just a tiny fraction of the code needed. You would need to add:

* **Authentication/Authorization:** Implement middleware to verify JWTs.
* **Data Visualization Library:** Integrate a library like Chart.js, D3.js, or a commercial solution.
* **API Endpoints (CRUD):** Create full CRUD operations for your data models.
* **Database Migrations:** Create migration files to manage database schema changes.
* **Testing:**  Write unit, integration, and API tests.
* **Dockerfile:** Create a Dockerfile to containerize your application.
* **CI/CD Pipeline:** Set up a pipeline using tools like GitLab CI/CD or GitHub Actions.
* **Detailed error handling and logging**


Remember to install all necessary dependencies using `npm install` or `yarn install`.  This example provides a foundational structure.  Building a full-scale application will take considerable time and effort.  Break down the problem into smaller, manageable tasks.  Focus on one module at a time, ensuring it works correctly before moving on.  This incremental approach will greatly improve your chances of success.
