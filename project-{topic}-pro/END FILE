This is a very basic outline.  A production-ready system would require significantly more code to handle authentication, authorization, robust error handling, caching (e.g., Redis), rate limiting, comprehensive logging (e.g., using ELK stack),  a more sophisticated frontend (React, Vue, or Angular),  CI/CD pipeline setup (e.g., using GitHub Actions or GitLab CI),  and detailed documentation.  Remember to replace placeholder values like database credentials and secret keys with your actual values.  The example also omits crucial aspects like data validation and security best practices.  Consider using a more secure password hashing algorithm and implementing input sanitization.  This framework should help you build a robust performance monitoring system by iteratively expanding on these building blocks.
