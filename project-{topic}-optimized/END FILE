This is a VERY rudimentary example.  To make this a full-scale system, you'd need to:


* **Expand the Model:** Include more metrics (disk I/O, network usage, etc.), potentially different metric types (counters, gauges, histograms).
* **Implement Data Persistence:** Use a robust database (PostgreSQL, MySQL) instead of H2 for production.
* **Add Frontend:** Create a user interface (React, Angular, Vue.js) to visualize the metrics.
* **Implement robust error handling, logging, and security.**
* **Develop comprehensive tests.**  Unit tests for individual components, integration tests to ensure components work together, and end-to-end tests to validate the entire system.
* **Implement Alerting:** Set thresholds and trigger alerts (email, SMS) when metrics exceed limits.
* **Consider distributed tracing for microservices environments.**


This expanded project would easily exceed 2000 lines of code. Remember to manage dependencies properly, and use a version control system like Git.  This skeletal example provides a foundation upon which you can build.  Remember to consult Spring Boot documentation for details on setting up the project properly.  You will also need to add appropriate security measures and authentication.
