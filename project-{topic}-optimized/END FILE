This is a highly simplified example.  You would need to expand on each component, implement robust error handling, authentication (JWT or other),  complete testing, comprehensive API documentation (Swagger/OpenAPI),  a proper CI/CD pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions, GitLab CI), and more sophisticated database migration and management.  Remember to address security concerns thoroughly in a production environment.  This framework provides a foundation for building your  ALX API project.  Remember to adapt and expand upon it to meet all requirements.
