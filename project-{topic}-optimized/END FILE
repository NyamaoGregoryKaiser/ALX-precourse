This is a VERY basic example.  A production-ready system would require:

* **Robust Error Handling:**  Proper exception handling and logging.
* **Security:** Authentication (e.g., JWT, OAuth 2.0) and authorization mechanisms.
* **Database Migrations:**  Using tools like Flyway or Liquibase.
* **Testing:**  Comprehensive unit, integration, and end-to-end tests.  Consider using tools like JUnit, Mockito, and Spring Test.
* **Caching:** Implement caching strategies (e.g., Redis) to improve performance.
* **Rate Limiting:** Prevent abuse of your API.
* **Deployment:**  Configure a proper CI/CD pipeline (e.g., using Jenkins, GitLab CI, or GitHub Actions) and Docker for containerization.
* **Documentation:**  Generate API documentation (e.g., using Swagger/OpenAPI).


Remember to replace placeholders and expand on this foundation to build a complete, production-ready system.  This example provides a starting point demonstrating core concepts.  Building a full-scale application requires much more code and careful design considerations.  Consider using a more structured project layout with separate modules for different concerns (e.g., a separate module for the data access layer).
