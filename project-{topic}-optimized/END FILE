**Secrets Configuration for GitHub Actions**:

You need to configure the following secrets in your GitHub repository settings (`Settings -> Secrets and variables -> Actions`):

*   `DOCKER_USERNAME`: Your Docker Hub username.
*   `DOCKER_TOKEN`: A Docker Hub Personal Access Token (PAT) with push/pull permissions.
*   `SSH_HOST`: The IP address or hostname of your deployment server.
*   `SSH_USERNAME`: The SSH username for your deployment server.
*   `SSH_KEY`: The private SSH key corresponding to a public key authorized on your deployment server. Use a deploy key if possible.

## 5. Monitoring and Logging

*   **Monitoring**: Spring Boot Actuator exposes `/actuator/health`, `/actuator/info`, `/actuator/metrics`, and `/actuator/prometheus` (if `micrometer-registry-prometheus` is added to `pom.xml`).
    *   Set up Prometheus to scrape metrics from `/actuator/prometheus`.
    *   Use Grafana to visualize these metrics for CPU usage, memory, request rates, error rates, cache hit ratios, etc.
*   **Logging**: Spring Boot uses Logback by default.
    *   Configure Logback to write logs to files, and use a log aggregation tool (e.g., ELK Stack - Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana; or Splunk, Datadog) to centralize and analyze logs from all instances.
    *   In `docker-compose.yml`, you can uncomment `volumes: - ./logs:/app/logs` to persist logs to the host machine. Docker's default `json-file` log driver can also be used by log aggregators.

## 6. Maintenance

*   **Regular Updates**: Keep your Spring Boot, Java, PostgreSQL, and other dependencies updated to receive security patches and new features.
*   **Database Backups**: Implement a robust database backup strategy for PostgreSQL.
*   **Monitoring Alerts**: Set up alerts in your monitoring system for critical metrics (e.g., high error rates, low disk space, high CPU usage).
*   **Security Audits**: Regularly review your code and configuration for security vulnerabilities.
*   **Cache Invalidation**: Monitor cache effectiveness and implement manual or scheduled cache invalidation if necessary.
