This is a VERY basic example. A real-world application would need:

* **Robust error handling:**  More comprehensive error handling throughout the application, including custom error classes and middleware.
* **Authentication and Authorization:** Middleware to verify user credentials and control access to resources.  Consider using JWTs.
* **Input validation:** Sanitize and validate all user inputs to prevent SQL injection and other vulnerabilities.
* **Query Optimization:**  Proper indexing, efficient query writing, and potentially connection pooling.  Analyze query plans with tools like `EXPLAIN`.
* **Comprehensive Testing:**  Unit tests for controllers, services, and database interactions. Integration and end-to-end tests.
* **Logging and Monitoring:** Integrate a logging library (like Winston or Bunyan) and monitoring tools.
* **Caching:** Implement caching (e.g., Redis) to reduce database load.
* **Dockerfile:** A Dockerfile to containerize the application and database.
* **CI/CD Pipeline:**  Use a CI/CD system (e.g., GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins) to automate building, testing, and deployment.
* **Database schema design:** Properly design your database schema with normalization and foreign keys.


Remember to replace placeholder comments and adapt the code to your specific requirements and chosen technologies.  This outline provides a strong starting point for a far more extensive project.  The 2000+ line target will easily be reached once you flesh out all the necessary features and components.
