This is a VERY rudimentary example. A production-ready system needs:

* **Robust Authentication and Authorization:**  Using JWTs or OAuth 2.0.
* **Secure Payment Gateway Integration:**  Stripe, PayPal, etc.  This is critical and requires specific API calls and security protocols.
* **Error Handling and Logging:**  Comprehensive error handling and logging to track issues and ensure data integrity.
* **Database Transactions:**  To ensure atomicity of operations (e.g., updating payment status and deducting funds).
* **Asynchronous Tasks:**  For processing payments and sending notifications. (Celery or similar)
* **Extensive Testing:**  Unit, integration, and end-to-end tests to cover all aspects of the system.
* **Deployment and Monitoring:**  Using tools like Kubernetes, Docker Swarm, or AWS for deployment and monitoring.


Remember to replace placeholder values (like database credentials and secret keys) with your own.  This is a starting point, not a complete solution. Building a full-scale payment processing system requires significant time, effort, and expertise.  Consider using existing frameworks and services to simplify the development process.
