...(This pattern would be repeated for users, authentication, etc.)...

This is a highly simplified example.  A production-ready system would require:

* **Robust Authentication and Authorization:**  Implementing secure user authentication (e.g., using Passport.js) and role-based access control (RBAC).
* **Comprehensive Error Handling:**  Implementing middleware to gracefully handle errors and return informative responses.
* **Input Validation:** Sanitizing and validating all user inputs to prevent vulnerabilities.
* **Database Migrations:** Using tools like Mongoose's built-in schema updates or a dedicated migration tool to manage database changes.
* **Testing Suite:**  Writing comprehensive unit, integration, and end-to-end tests using frameworks like Jest and Supertest.
* **Deployment Strategy:**  Setting up a CI/CD pipeline using tools like GitLab CI, GitHub Actions, or Jenkins.
* **Frontend (React):**  Building a complete React frontend to interact with the API endpoints.
* **Caching:** Implementing caching mechanisms (e.g., Redis) to improve performance.
* **Logging and Monitoring:** Using tools like Winston or Bunyan for logging and services like Sentry or Datadog for monitoring.


This abbreviated example provides a foundation.  A real-world CMS would be orders of magnitude larger and more complex, requiring a team effort and adherence to best practices for security, scalability, and maintainability.
