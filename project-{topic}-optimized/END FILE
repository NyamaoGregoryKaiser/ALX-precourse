This is a highly simplified example. A real-world application would require:

* **Error Handling:** Robust error handling throughout the application.
* **HTTP Library:**  A full-featured HTTP library (like libcurl or a C++ wrapper around another library) for robust web requests.
* **Web Framework:** A C++ web framework (like Crow, Drogon, or Pistache) for building the API.
* **Database:**  A more robust database solution (PostgreSQL or MySQL) instead of SQLite for production.
* **Asynchronous Operations:**  Asynchronous operations (using threads or async libraries) to improve performance, especially when handling multiple requests concurrently.
* **Parsing:**  Libraries or custom code for parsing HTML or other data formats.
* **Rate Limiting and Politeness:** Implement mechanisms to respect website robots.txt and avoid overloading target servers.
* **Authentication and Authorization:** Secure access to the API.
* **Testing Framework:**  A testing framework like Google Test or Catch2 for unit and integration tests.
* **Deployment:**  Proper deployment using Docker and a CI/CD pipeline (e.g., GitLab CI, GitHub Actions, Jenkins).

Remember to install necessary libraries (e.g., `libcurl`, `libsqlite3`, your chosen web framework) before compiling.  This example provides a starting point; building a complete system will require much more code and effort.  This response aims to illustrate the structure and key components involved.  Focusing on the ALX pre-course materials will help you solve the many programming challenges in implementing a system of this complexity.
