This is a highly simplified example.  A full-scale project would require:

* **More sophisticated machine learning models:**  Explore libraries like scikit-learn (if using Python backend), TensorFlow, or PyTorch for more advanced algorithms.
* **Data preprocessing:** Handling missing values, feature scaling, encoding categorical variables are crucial.
* **Model training and evaluation:** Implement proper training, validation, and testing procedures.  Track metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, etc.
* **Deployment:**  Use a robust deployment platform like AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure.
* **API security:** Implement robust authentication and authorization mechanisms.
* **Extensive testing:**  Write unit, integration, and end-to-end tests to ensure code quality.


This expanded example provides a foundation.  Remember to install necessary dependencies and configure your database correctly.  This requires significantly more code to reach the 2000+ line goal and to be truly production-ready.  The  provided snippet is a starting point to guide your development. Remember to consider error handling, logging, and security best practices throughout your implementation.
