This is a highly simplified example.  A full-fledged project would require:

* **Robust Authentication and Authorization:**  Implement JWT or OAuth for secure authentication.  Use middleware to protect routes based on user roles.
* **Comprehensive Routing:** Define clear routes for all CRUD operations on each resource.
* **Data Validation:**  Validate all incoming data using libraries like `joi` or `express-validator`.
* **Error Handling Middleware:** Create a middleware function to catch and handle errors gracefully, returning appropriate HTTP status codes.
* **Logging and Monitoring:** Integrate with tools like Winston or Bunyan for logging, and Prometheus or Datadog for monitoring.
* **Caching:** Implement caching (e.g., Redis) to improve performance.
* **Rate Limiting:** Prevent abuse by implementing rate limiting (e.g., using `express-rate-limit`).
* **Testing:** Write extensive unit, integration, and API tests using Jest or similar frameworks. Achieve high test coverage.
* **Docker Setup:** Create a `Dockerfile` to containerize your application.
* **CI/CD Pipeline:** Set up a CI/CD pipeline (e.g., using GitHub Actions or GitLab CI) for automated testing and deployment.

Remember to replace placeholder values like passwords and database credentials with your actual details.  Use strong password hashing techniques (like bcrypt) for security. This expanded structure provides a strong foundation for your project;  building a full application from scratch requires significant coding effort.  Focus on one section at a time, building incrementally and thoroughly testing each step.
