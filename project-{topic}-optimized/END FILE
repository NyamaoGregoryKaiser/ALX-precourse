This is a drastically simplified example. A production-ready system requires significantly more code for robust error handling, security, comprehensive testing,  a complete frontend (React, for instance), CI/CD pipeline setup (e.g., with GitHub Actions or GitLab CI),  and detailed documentation.  Remember to replace placeholder comments with actual implementations, and adapt it to your specific needs.  Remember to handle security best practices, such as input validation and preventing SQL injection.  Using environment variables for sensitive information (database credentials, JWT secrets) is crucial.  This is just a starting point to guide your development.
