# Task Management System

This project implements a simple task management system using C++ for the backend and a placeholder for a frontend (you'll need to implement this).

## Dependencies

* [List your C++ dependencies here, if any.  Example:  SQLite (for database)]

## Setup

1.  Clone the repository.
2.  Install dependencies (if any).
3.  Configure the database (see `database/schema.sql`).
4.  Run the application.  (Instructions specific to your application setup.)
5.  (You would add instructions for building a frontend and connecting it here.)

## API Documentation

**(To be added - this section should be populated with API endpoint documentation once the backend is developed.)**

## Architecture

**(To be added -  A diagram or description of the system architecture should be included here.)**
