```typescript
import express, { Request, Response, Router } from 'express';
//import {User} from '../models/user'; //Needs model definition

export const router: Router = express.Router();

//Basic user registration route (Needs security improvements)
router.post('/register', async (req: Request, res: Response) => {
  const {username, password} = req.body;
  //Implement user registration logic with password hashing and db interaction
  res.send('User Registered');
});
