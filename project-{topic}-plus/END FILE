This is a highly simplified example.  A production-ready system would require:

* **Database Integration:**  A robust database schema (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL) with tables for products, users, orders, shopping carts, etc.  Include migration scripts for database schema updates.  Implement proper ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) using TypeORM or Sequelize.
* **Authentication & Authorization:** Implement secure authentication using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) and robust authorization mechanisms to control access to resources.
* **Error Handling:**  Comprehensive error handling middleware to gracefully manage exceptions and provide informative error responses.
* **Testing:**  Extensive unit, integration, and end-to-end tests using Jest or similar testing frameworks.  Aim for high test coverage.
* **Deployment:** Use Docker for containerization and orchestration (Kubernetes).  Set up a CI/CD pipeline using tools like GitLab CI, GitHub Actions, or Jenkins.
* **Caching:** Implement caching strategies (Redis, Memcached) to improve performance.
* **Rate Limiting:** Prevent abuse with rate limiting middleware.
* **Security:**  Implement security best practices to prevent common vulnerabilities like SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and cross-site request forgery (CSRF).


This expanded structure, along with comprehensive error handling, testing, and security measures, would bring the codebase well beyond 2000 lines.  Remember to break down the project into smaller, manageable modules and components.  The provided snippets are a starting point â€“ you'll need to build out the features significantly to create a functional e-commerce application.
