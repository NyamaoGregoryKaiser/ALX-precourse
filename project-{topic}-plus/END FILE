This is a vastly simplified example. A real-world project would require:

* **A robust frontend:**  Consider using a framework like React, Angular, or Vue.js for a client-side interface.
* **A more sophisticated backend:**  Use a framework like Boost.Beast or a more complete web framework for C++ for handling HTTP requests and responses.
* **Comprehensive error handling:**  Implement proper error handling and logging throughout the application.
* **Authentication and authorization:**  Integrate a secure authentication mechanism (e.g., JWT).
* **Testing framework:**  Use a C++ testing framework (e.g., Google Test) to write unit and integration tests.
* **CI/CD pipeline:** Configure a CI/CD pipeline using tools like GitLab CI, GitHub Actions, or Jenkins.

Remember to replace placeholder comments and adapt the code to your specific needs and chosen technologies.  This expanded structure will help you organize your project more effectively as it grows in complexity.  The most critical aspect is to break down the system into smaller, manageable modules and then systematically implement and test each module.
