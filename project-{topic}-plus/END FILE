This is a highly simplified example.  A production-ready CMS would require:

* **Robust authentication and authorization:**  Implement roles and permissions.  Consider using a well-established OAuth provider.
* **Database migrations:** Use Sequelize migrations to manage database schema changes.
* **Comprehensive testing:**  Write unit, integration, and end-to-end tests.
* **Error handling:** Implement proper error handling and logging throughout the application.
* **Input validation:** Sanitize and validate all user inputs to prevent vulnerabilities.
* **Caching:** Implement caching to improve performance.
* **Deployment pipeline:** Set up a CI/CD pipeline for automated builds and deployments.
* **Frontend:**  A full CMS needs a robust frontend (React, Vue, Angular, etc.) to handle user interactions.


This skeletal example provides a starting point. You must considerably expand upon it to meet the requirements of a production-ready CMS.  Remember to break down the project into smaller, manageable tasks and follow best practices for software development.  Refer to the ALX Software Engineering precourse materials for guidance on algorithms, data structures, and problem-solving strategies.
