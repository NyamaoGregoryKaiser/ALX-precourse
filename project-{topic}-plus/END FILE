This is a highly simplified example. A production-ready system needs far more robust error handling, security measures, testing, and a much more sophisticated CI/CD pipeline. Remember to replace placeholder values (database credentials, Docker registry) with your actual information.  You'll also need to implement proper unit, integration, and API tests using `pytest`.  This example only provides a foundational structure.  Consider expanding on this by incorporating features like user roles, granular permissions, request validation,  advanced caching mechanisms, and robust logging.  Finally, explore more advanced container orchestration tools (like Kubernetes) for production deployment.
